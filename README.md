# Game_Of_Life_Cpp
Academic implementation of Game of Life. Made in objective C++

It was my first OOP project made for academic purposes.

<i>Translation: 
Press T to go to the next round.
Press S to save or L to load. (It implements gamesaves).
</i>

It is a console app fully written in polish. It works almost like original Game of Life but it has some improvements.

I've implemented a human which has a special ability and player can control him.
There are new types of organisms which have various skills.
